# ItemQualityAsText

This addon was originally created by *Cavalier07* and posted to [ESOUI](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info745-ItemQualityasText.html).

As a colorblind player, I have updated the addon to restore functionality following game and API updates.

The below is a copy of the original description for prosperity.
